# EX 3C Sudoku Solver
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a python program to find the solution of sudoku puzzle using Backtracking.


## Algorithm
1.Find the first empty cell in the Sudoku grid (usually represented by a 0).

2.Check if placing a number (1 to 9) in that cell is valid, based on Sudoku rules (row, column, and 3Ã—3 box).

3.Try placing each number from 1 to 9 in the empty cell if it's valid.

4.Recursively repeat the process for the next empty cell (backtracking if no valid number fits).

5.If the grid is filled without conflict, the puzzle is solved; otherwise, backtrack to try other options.
